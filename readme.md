NOTE
  - Branch for grading: master
  - Start application by running GuiStart.java
  - Developed and tested on Windows 10 and 11.
  - Please import A4_Final/A4_Final_JavaFX in Eclipse. Note that it might take a while to completely pull everything from GitHub.
  - The music player streams songs, so you need **consistent** internet connection to use the music player
  - The program uses libraries to make API call. There will be some waiting and loading in the background as the API data is being retrieved. Note that the program might freeze and resume its normal operation afterward if you try to search/load songs without internet.
  - There is a 20 tracks limit per playlist due to the fact that there are only 20 buttons variables set up. Since the Library is a playlist, this means that the library might not contain all the songs that another playlist has once the library reaches its limit.
